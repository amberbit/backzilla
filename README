Backzilla
=========

Summary
=======
Backzilla is a multi-purpose backup tool based on duplicity - 'Encrypted bandwidth-efficient backup using the rsync algorithm' (http://duplicity.nongnu.org).

It can backup multiple entities (for example: MySQL database, directory, etc) to multiple destinations (for example: FTP, directory, etc). For ease of use entities are groupped into 'projects'. This allows to manually backup/restore the whole project at once or just a single entity. Each entity knows how to restore itself from the backup destination. Projects and backup stores are configured using YAML files (look in examples).

Usage
=====
no gem available currently

git clone
path_to_repo/bin/backzilla -b project_name[:entity_name]

Backzilla will look for ~/.backzilla/projects.yaml and ~/.backzilla/stores.yaml files. If not present example files will be created there.

Current state
=============
Backup part is generally done. Needs some polishing though. Restore isn't implemented yet. Probably the script should also catch CTRL+C or any other interruptions and perform some wise cleanup.
- -m switch - move project_name to new_project_name or project_name:entity_name to new_project_name:new_entity_name in all stores
- always backup ~/.backzilla too

Entities
========
- MySQL
- Directory

Stores
======
- FTP
- Directory

It should be fairly easy to implement new store as duplicity
